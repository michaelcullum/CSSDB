CSSDB
=====

CSSDB is a system where you can add docblocks to CSS code.

CSS is always the first language to turn into spagetti code and always 
ends up worse. Some websites end up with thousands of lines of CSS.

CSSDB solves that problem by having simple docblocks in your CSS you 
can create living style guides, API docs (for quick reference),
it also can be helpful to have descriptors in your code to desribe
the exact usage of an element.

It also works well with pre-processors (especially SCSS) with variables,
modifers, nesting and more.
